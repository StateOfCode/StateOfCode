title: "Fractal Strong Rendering"
---

I was following the tutorial [insert link] on the Mandelbulb3D rendering when I was forced to go to postprocessing window by the next step. Till now, I was trying to avoid postprocessing cause, well, it does sound like something you hire a lawyer to do.
The postprocessing tab has [image]... cpu cycles
# points
-It exploded with the cpu time requirement.
-Disclaimer: I'm noob and don't know what I'm talking about.
-Every new level seemed to multiply rendering time.
-Segway into post-baked lighting, specular and diffuse, background, raytracing, things in postprocessing - all separate rendering.
-Set to render overnight.
-Morning, new artifacts.
-Struggle with the color.
-Contlusion.
