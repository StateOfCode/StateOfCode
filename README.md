[StateOfCode](/about/) is my professional blog where I finally get to put down my thoughts on technology and share what is my passion - who to make stuff work. I post about Selenium, other C# libraries, how they are used in the era of virtualization and remote work. I also will share methodologies and documentation structures that I have an experience with seeing work in a professional setting along with obstacles that were discovered and unseen at the time.
